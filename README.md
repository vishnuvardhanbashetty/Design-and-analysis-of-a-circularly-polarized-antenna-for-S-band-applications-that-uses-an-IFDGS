# Design-and-analysis-of-a-circularly-polarized-antenna-for-S-band-applications-that-uses-an-IFDGS
Circular polarization (CP) single feed square patch with inclined fractal defective ground structure (IFDGS) microstrip antenna is proposed. An  angled fractal-shaped slot implanted along the diagonal axis of a ground plane produces CP radiation. An inclined fractal structure is slotted into the ground plane to improve the antenna's performance metrics such as axial ratio bandwidth, return loss bandwidth, and gain. The IFDGS parameter studies are presented to demonstrate how to obtain CP radiation and measurement of the CP antenna with the third iterative IFDGS. The overall dimension of 41x 41x1.6 mm3, the suggested antenna achieved CP radiation at 2.61 GHz. The proposed antenna's highest gain was measured to be 3.44 dB. The proposed antenna could be used for S-band wireless communication.
